# 8QueensAnd8Puzzle
This repository shows my solutions to the 8 Queens and 8 Puzzle problems.
Each solution uses Hill Climbing with and without Random restart and graphs the data using matplotlib.
# Usage 
To run the solutions clone this repository using the Git CLI. Then you can cd into either directory and run main.py. It will auto generate unique test cases for the problem and solve immediately. Results will be displayed using matplot lib and saved locally in png files.
